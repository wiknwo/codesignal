'''Line Encoding

    Given a string, return its encoding defined as follows:
    
    First, the string is divided into the least possible number 
    of disjoint substrings consisting of identical characters
    
    Next, each substring with length greater than one is replaced 
    with a concatenation of its length and the repeating character
    
    Finally, all the new strings are concatenated together in the 
    same order and a new string is returned.
    
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
